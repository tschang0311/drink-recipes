            <ol type="I">
                <li class="p">In a medium sauce pan, bring 1 oz of ice and 1 L of water to a boil. Make sure to constantly stir to get the best results!</li>
                <li class="p">Let mixture cool and pour into a large glass container. Freeze over night.</li>
                <li class="p">Take frozen water out of the freezer and place into a fine-mesh strainer. Collect water in a plastic tub and add dry ice.
                Insert tube and blow air into the bottom of the plastic tub.
                </li>
                <li class="p">After all the dry ice has sublimed, strain once more in a medium to large number colander before marinating in the fridge for a couple of hours.</li>
                <li class="p">Serve water in a tall glass with crushed (<em>Tip: </em>Use cubed ice if crushed ice is not available) ice and enjoy knowing that your water is 
                purified down to its molecular makeup!</li>
